# Duke Ignite: Duke Dining Calorie Tracker
By: Josh Chen, Bryant Chung, Dylan Mitchell

We made an app to help track your daily calories from dining at Duke. It was built to better inform your dining decisions with information like calories, grams of fat, protein, and sugars about food options on campus, along with helpful nutritional metrics like daily caloric intake and weekly averages. 

This project was built with NextJS (a React framework) and uses Google Firebase as the database.
